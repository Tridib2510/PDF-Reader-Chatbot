Draw the Ready Queue (RQ) timeline – mark arrivals, completions of I/O, and dispatcher actions.2. Start the Gantt chart at  – ensures idle periods are visible.3. Follow the transition diagram strictly (Ready → Running → Blocked → Ready).4. Do not add dispatcher latency to waiting time – only to the total schedule length.5.

If no cycle → request granted, system stays safe.2. If cycle appears → the system becomes unsafe; further granting may lead to deadlock.\\nBanker’s Algorithm Overview 💰\\nThe algorithm handles multiple instances of multiple resources and consists of two parts:\\n1.

Process ‑ Based Recovery (Abort)\\nAbort: Terminating one or more processes to break the circular wait.\\nSingle ‑ process abort:Remove a process (e.g., P₃) → its resources are freed to P₂, allowing P₂ to finish, then P₁ can complete.Cost: One process is sacrificed.All ‑ process abort:Terminate every process involved in the deadlock cycle.\\n2. Resource Preemption\\nPreemption: Temporarily taking resources from one process and assigning them to another.\\nChoose a strong (higher ‑ priority) process, e.g., P₂, to snatch resources from a weaker process (P₃).P₂ completes, releases resources to P₁, which then finishes and returns resources to P₃.Result: No process is killed; all eventually complete.\\n3.

This reduces memory overhead compared to spawning full processes and improvesapplication responsiveness.\\n💰 Economy & Overhead\\nProcess creation – allocating memory and resources for a new process is expensive.\\nGiving every process its own full set of resources harms system economy.Thread creation uses only a Thread Control Block (TCB), which is smaller than a Process Control Block (PCB), so it is farcheaper.\\nEmpirical example – on Solaris, creating a process costs about 30 × more than creating a thread.\\nContext ‑ Switching Cost\\nContext switch – the act of storing the state of a running entity and restoring the state of another.\\nSwitching a process swaps the larger PCB; switching a thread swaps the smaller TCB.Consequently, thread ‑ to ‑ thread switching is noticeably faster than process ‑ to ‑ process switching.\\n⚙ Scalability & Multi ‑ processor\\nIn a multiprocessor (more than one CPU) environment, multithreading gains extra advantage because threads can run inparallel on different CPUs.A single ‑ threaded process can occupy only one CPU, leaving other CPUs idle.\\nConcurrency vs. Parallelism\\nConcurrency – dealing with multiple tasks at the same time by interleaving execution (e.g., round ‑ robin scheduling).'),\n",
