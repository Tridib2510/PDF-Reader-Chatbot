4. CatBoost Classifier 
Why we used it: 
• Designed to handle categorical features automatically (like gender, age group, response 
types) 
• Requires less preprocessing 
• Performs well out of the box with minimal tuning 
• Handles imbalanced and noisy data effectively 
Ideal for: 
• Real-world data that’s messy or includes non-numeric responses (e.g., “Often,” “Rarely”) \n \n
